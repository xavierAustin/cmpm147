					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Xavier Austin is an undergraduate at UCSC, majoring in Computer Science: Game Design. Their hobbys include hiking, baking, doom-scrolling, overthinking, and- you'll have to guess the last one. They're extremely comfortable with C and other languages close to hardware, have a soft spot for Pytho, having self-taught themselves this language in highschool, and cannot understand object-based languages to save their life.</p>
